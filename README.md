# ClarifyBoxRemoverExtension

An extension I created to remove the context box that would appear below YouTube videos.

Frequently, I find these appear on videos that either don't fit the context of the video,
or linked towards dubious Wikipedia articles.

This created more clutter on the page, with video pages already being an annoying mess.
